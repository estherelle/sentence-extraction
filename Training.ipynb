      "1. This is the second part of a series of Natural Language Processing tutorials for beginners.\n",
      "2. For an introduction to NLP, please check out the  first part.\n",
      "3. Tim is a little guy who likes to build things with his varied Lego© pieces.\n",
      "4. However, Tim is a bit messy, so he keeps all the components of his different puzzles in a big drawer.\n",
      "5. He now wants to build a castle with some Lego© pieces but, in order to do that (since he is very meticulous with his artworks), he first selects the pieces that could be useful from the entire set by selecting only Lego© pieces.\n",
      "6. Then, he removes the damaged pieces and the ones that he does not find useful for his purpose, and unifies some small ones that could fit together in a block.\n",
      "7. Later, he groups pieces by their colour, shape or purpose.\n",
      "8. Shortly after, Tim brings all the pieces together in a specific order and builds his mighty castle.\n",
      "9. Finally, he can play with it.\n",
      "10. LEGO © meme (s ource ) In this post we will see that, when we try to approach an NLP task (and also most of Machine Learning ones), we should behave like Tim.\n",
      "11. We as humans are drawers in a way, with all of our biometrics, phone calls, contact agenda, YouTube views, films, series, songs, text messages, tweets, books, activities, commutes, and so on.\n",
      "12. A good example is an SQL table.\n",
      "13. SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.\n",
      "14. This means that data is structured and related through different columns.\n",
      "15. In figure 1 we can see 2 columns that can take numerical values ( EmployeeId  and  DepartmentId ) and other two for textual information ( LastName  and  Coutry ).\n",
      "16. I like to think of this type of information as information that we don’t currently know how we process and manipulate (cognitively).\n",
      "17. We can conceive NLP as the different set of tools that can be applied in order to structure natural language for different purposes.\n",
      "18. As it was mentioned in the  first part  of the series, our dataset will be called  corpus , since it is composed by a set of textual information (the plural is  corpora ).\n",
      "19. We can think of this corpus as the set of Lego ©  pieces that Tim selects initially, by discarding pieces from other puzzles.\n",
      "20. Preprocessing ( source ) When Tim removes the damaged or unuseful pieces from his set, this is called the  preprocessing step , in which he tries to select useful pieces for the building process.\n",
      "21. When we preprocess the data, in NLP we name it  text normalization  or data preparation, since we are trying to ‘normalize’ in some way the elements of our corpus.\n",
      "22. The following posts will cover each of the different tools that can be applied in each step, but, for the sake of argument, if we have both  cat and   cats  in our corpus, we would be interested in normalizing them by unifying both terms into  cat  (this, as we will see, is called stemming).\n",
      "23. Other examples would be splitting the corpus into different sentences or removing URLs and other elements that could be present in our corpus and may not be of our interest for the task.\n",
      "24. This is the  structuring step , in which we choose which are the elements that we want to detect.\n",
      "25. For example, suppose that our corpus includes several countries, names of people, trademarks or animals that we want to detect as different elements.\n",
      "26. The  intents  or actions written by users.\n",
      "27. Imagine that our corpus is comprised of online flight bookings from different users, then the intents would be the actions or options that the user could have available.\n",
      "28. ‘Is there any booking available for tomorrow?’ ) or  saveBookingProcess  (e.\n",
      "29. ‘I want to continue later.\n",
      "30. Please, save it’ ) would be example intents.\n",
      "31. We may want to extract only the verbs and nouns from the corpus to analyse them.\n",
      "32. The syntactic role of each element in the corpus through  dependency parsing , maybe to extract only the subjects from the corpus or other dependencies.\n",
      "33. The different topics that are present in the corpus, grouped by terms through  topic modeling  techniques.\n",
      "34. Topic modeling ( source ) The feelings that are present in the text, quantifying them through  sentiment analysis.\n",
      "35. Sentiment analysis ( source ) As it was already mentioned, the structuring tools applied will depend on the objective that we have.\n",
      "36. This is the  analysis step , in which we extract different features in order to perform the task that we had in mind.\n",
      "37. We now want to bring all the pieces together in a specific order like Tim did to build his castle.\n",
      "38. Sometimes this step just consists in counting down the different elements (e.\n",
      "39. count the number of instances for each sentiment class to get an insight of the overall feeling), but in other cases we may want to use the features in a more complex model, such as a machine learning algorithm (e.\n",
      "40. train a neural network that transforms entities into vectors or translates from one language to another).\n",
      "41. This is the  transformation step , the last one in the workflow.\n",
      "42. In this step the purpose is to translate the obtained information into an interpretable source in order to make our decision, observe it or analyse it.\n",
      "43. Word representation through vectors ( source ) As with the analysis, this can vary from problem to problem.\n",
      "44. Sometimes this step simply involves outputting the conclusions visually (e.\n",
      "45. representing the obtained vectors as points in 2 or 3 dimensions), a proportion (e.\n",
      "46. the percentage for each sentiment class) or a predominant detected class (e.\n",
      "47. the sentiment class that obtained a higher count).\n",
      "48. It can also involve more complex tasks such as language generation (e.\n",
      "49. generating a novel or personalised response for a user request) or speech synthesis (e.\n",
      "50. producing a response with a human voice).\n",
      "51. The next post will cover the different possibilities available in a preprocessing step coding examples with  SpaCy.\n",
