That’s how working together should be. Instead, information is scattered and responsibilities are unclear. We try to cut through the chaos with endless meetings and micromanagement, but we end up with less time and not much more clarity.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Work shouldn’t be chaos\\n  \\n\\n    At Asana, we’re building a place where everything from the most immediate details to the big picture are organized. With Asana, each person knows what they should be doing and why. This clarity, transparency, and focus allows teams to collaborate with less friction and produce great results.We believe coordination should be as effortless between people as it is between our own brains and bodies, that people should be appreciated, and love what they do.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy empowering all teams to work together, we help humanity thrive.\\n\\n\\n\\n            Get to know Asana\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe stay connected through our shared mission and values\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocus on our mission\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe continually ground in why we’re building Asana: to help all teams work together effortlessly. We attempt to establish a direct line between that purpose and our day-to-day work. We answer strategic conflicts by asking the question: which choice maximizes the success of our mission?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmbrace mindfulness and equanimity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe start with awareness. We let go of stories we’re telling ourselves about heroes, victims, and villains, and we accept wherever we are. We reflect on our past experiences and we act intentionally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPractice balance in all things, including balance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough it is tempting to pick an extreme point of view or compromise between two poles, the best outcomes often require incorporating elements of each extreme or, better yet, transcending them altogether through synthesis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClarify who’s doing what by when, how, and why\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA fundamental problem with modern work is that too much time is spent trying to figure out what’s going on. We try to make it as easy as possible for teams to have the information they need to excel at their work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTake and give full responsibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsana is an experiment in the idea that the responsibility should be distributed among a great team of peers that respect and trust each other, so we proactively build relationships and seek to understand each other. We let go when we’re not the Directly Responsible Individual, and we take action when we are. We empower each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe real with yourself and others\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe take our commitments to each other seriously. We admit when we’re wrong. We treat ourselves as whole people at work. We feel our feelings all the way through and we’re not afraid to give constructive feedback or disagree. We embrace reality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate and play together\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are co-creating Asana together, and we’re playful while we do it. We maintain an attitude of curiosity, fearlessness, and creativity around tough problems. We embrace failure as learning and celebrate iteration. We don’t hide from our quirks. We appreciate each other and don’t take success for granted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfunction skrollTo(o){$(\"html, body\").animate({scrollTop:$(o).offset().top-100},500)}function

That’s how working together should be. Instead, information is scattered and responsibilities are unclear. We try to cut through the chaos with endless meetings and micromanagement, but we end up with less time and not much more clarity.\\nWork shouldn’t be chaos\\nAt Asana, we’re building a place where everything from the most immediate details to the big picture are organized. With Asana, each person knows what they should be doing and why. This clarity, transparency, and focus allows teams to collaborate with less friction and produce great results.We believe coordination should be as effortless between people as it is between our own brains and bodies, that people should be appreciated, and love what they do.\\nBy empowering all teams to work together, we help humanity thrive.\\nGet to know Asana\\nWe stay connected through our shared mission and values\\nFocus on our mission\\nWe continually ground in why we’re building Asana: to help all teams work together effortlessly. We attempt to establish a direct line between that purpose and our day-to-day work. We answer strategic conflicts by asking the question: which choice maximizes the success of our mission?\\nEmbrace mindfulness and equanimity\\nWe start with awareness. We let go of stories we’re telling ourselves about heroes, victims, and villains, and we accept wherever we are. We reflect on our past experiences and we act intentionally.\\nPractice balance in all things, including balance\\nThough it is tempting to pick an extreme point of view or compromise between two poles, the best outcomes often require incorporating elements of each extreme or, better yet, transcending them altogether through synthesis.\\nClarify who’s doing what by when, how, and why\\nA fundamental problem with modern work is that too much time is spent trying to figure out what’s going on. We try to make it as easy as possible for teams to have the information they need to excel at their work.\\nTake and give full responsibility\\nAsana is an experiment in the idea that the responsibility should be distributed among a great team of peers that respect and trust each other, so we proactively build relationships and seek to understand each other. We let go when we’re not the Directly Responsible Individual, and we take action when we are. We empower each other.\\nBe real with yourself and others\\nWe take our commitments to each other seriously. We admit when we’re wrong. We treat ourselves as whole people at work. We feel our feelings all the way through and we’re not afraid to give constructive feedback or disagree. We embrace reality.\\nCreate and play together\\nWe are co-creating Asana together, and we’re playful while we do it. We maintain an attitude of curiosity, fearlessness, and creativity around tough problems. We embrace failure as learning and celebrate iteration. We don’t hide from our quirks. We appreciate each other and don’t take success for granted.\\nfunction skrollTo(o){$(\"html, body\").animate({scrollTop:$(o).offset().top-100},500)}function
